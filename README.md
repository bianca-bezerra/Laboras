## Versions

This project branchs are complicated. Basically they define three project variatons:

`main, dev`: Primary version of Laboras, made to work with the [original backend on DRF](https://github.com/ryofac/rede-social-django-rest). Relatively a litte out of date and broken, but in the future, will go back as main version.

`next-api`: Second version of Laboras, made to work with the [backend of Next.js fullstack flavor](https://github.com/msruan/next-api). Out of date at the same point as primary version, and maybe broken. Current depreciated, because Next.js has a separeted frontend.

`neo, neo-dev`: Third and current the last version of Laboras, made to work with the [new FastAPI-Neo4j backend](https://github.com/ryofac/rede_social_fast_neo4j.git). Current the active version, with some new features like celebrations. Its most updated branch is _neo-dev_.
