`next-api`: A second version of Laboras, developed to integrate with the [Next.js fullstack backend](https://github.com/msruan/next-api). It is as outdated as the primary version and potentially broken. This version is currently deprecated since Next.js flavor now has its own separate frontend.

`neo, neo-dev`: The last and currently active version of Laboras, built to work with the [FastAPI-Neo4j backend](https://github.com/ryofac/rede_social_fast_neo4j.git). This version introduce new features such as celebrations. The most up-to-date branch is _neo-dev_.
